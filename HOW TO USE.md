# RestEndpoints
Install database :

 sudo apt-get install postgresql
 
 Create db in postgres, after that restore db from project:
 
 sudo -u postgres psql upload_data < filePath/uploadData.sql
 
 Build project in the IDE (I`m used netbeans 8.1, webserver tomcat version 8...)
  
 Run and test:
 
 Run app from IDE, on the page you will see three buttons (Choose file, Upload file abd Download result)
